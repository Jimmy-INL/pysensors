    "* Sensors measure quantities of interest\n",
    "* Abstractly, can think of them as measurements at different points in space\n",
    "* Given that you want to measure something, where to place your sensors? How many to place?\n",
    "* The search space is combinatorial: with $p$ sensors and $n$ locations, there are $\\frac{n!}{(n-p)!p!}$ ways to place them. Placing sensors at all $n$ locations is usually not practical (and typically not necessary)\n",
    "* The underlying field/object is often structured in such a way that only a small number of sensors are needed.\n",
    "* E.g. consider the sequence of measurements of the following function: how many do you need before you \"get the picture\"?"
